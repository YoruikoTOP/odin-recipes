For this assignement, I think the main goal will be to get more and more used to all the git workflow, especially commit, and practice more HTML.


It was a good practice, I create few html pages with relatives links inside, ordered and unordered list, img links, heading.
Tried to commit, not on every changed i made but everytime i thing it mattered, maybe my commit message isnt the best i'll see in the future.
